added model, hit save, when to model index instead of model detail, but cannot duplicate

in Search, max length for a single key word is 98


searching SearchAddOrUpdateForm needs more testing between Create and Update
check Update remove category!

searching should fail gracefully if violating duplicate search

read up on testfixtures
http://testfixtures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/django.html
try to implement
if cannot, remove from requirements/local.txt


find where the logs are stored!


test save model (request.user problem saving new model), fixed by
1) in the views: adding get_form_kwargs()
2) in the form __init__ method: self.user = kwargs.pop('user')


searching/utils
handle search executed OK but returned no items

need some tests in core/tests/test_utils_ebay.py and categories/tests/test_utils.py


set up search tips page!


check whether submodel functionality will id A-326B as Altec 326
check whether itemsfound & useritemsfound 162946585770 get processed (entered manually)

maybe overdone:
self.client.login(username ='username1', password='mypassword')

had single form per model, now have 2, create & update, only testing create, need to test update

implement or remove bMustHaveBrand (inverse of bGenericModel?)

fill in iItemHits in searchlogs

should catch


while running server and choosing items to archive, getting lots of errors
[WARNING] get_response: Not Found: /favicon.ico
but cannot find favicon.ico!


do a model search, if there are to many hits for one page, the link to page 2 forgets the query string
must fix!

if you edit an user item found and change to the model of an existing user item found for that item, you hit an error
should handle gracefully


choose add a model, change mind, hit cancel, but cannot,
screen insists title must be filled in


If you put in 12AX7A and turn on submodels OK, give error if Look For has 12AX7.


search can fail but cLastResult = Success -- not right


ebay api search by keyword seems not to accept list of negative key words w/o any positive,
must investigate!

want for tube amp search:
-akai -hitachi -kenwood -magnavox -mitsubishi -pioneer -realistic -sansui -toshiba -yamaha



searching/utilsearch
search executed OK but returned zero items
now need to handle better, zero results are more common



searching/utilsearch.py
FixMe! zero results are more common now


need to gracefully handle search failure when internet non-functioning



should handle more gracefully:

searching title, already exclude what comes after "for"
should also exclude what comes after "used with"

2019-02-16
on the item hit page, have total stars, give the multipliers for model brand & category
on the model page, put separators between the different look fors
