while running server and choosing items to archive, getting lots of errors
[WARNING] get_response: Not Found: /favicon.ico
but cannot find favicon.ico!


do a model search, if there are to many hits for one page, the link to page 2 forgets the query string
must fix!

if you edit an user item found and change to the model of an existing user item found for that item, you hit an error
should handle gracefully


choose add a model, change mind, hit cancel, but cannot,
screen insists title must be filled in


If you put in 12AX7A and turn on submodels OK, give error if Look For has 12AX7.


search can fail but cLastResult = Success -- not right


ebay api search by keyword seems not to accept list of negative key words w/o any positive,
must investigate!

want for tube amp search:

searching/utilsearch
search executed OK but returned zero items
now need to handle better, zero results are more common



searching/utilsearch.py
FixMe! zero results are more common now


need to gracefully handle search failure when internet non-functioning


searching title, already exclude what comes after "for"

2019-12-22 have some orphan keepers -- keepers with no userkeeper row
all are old -- there is no row in itemsfound

create temp table of orphan keepers:

create table temp_orphan_keepers as
select "iItemNumb" from keepers k
    where not exists
    ( select 1 from userkeepers uk where uk."iItemNumb_id" = k."iItemNumb" ) ;

verify there are no itemsfound for the oprhans:

SELECT
    count(*)
FROM
    itemsfound if
    WHERE
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM temp_orphan_keepers tok
        WHERE tok."iItemNumb" = if."iItemNumb" ) ;

challenge: find hits for orphan keepers


2019-12-23 is bMustHaveBrand redundant?  is bGenericModel enough?

2020-01-25 Select and/or trash zero bid keepers

2020-01-29 for a model, leaving the brand blank should equal bGenericModel, the latter is redundant

Category should be able to link to ebay category
Category Manuals should be able to link to ebay category for Vintage manuals
so if an item is in ebay category for Vintage manuals,
Category should be Manuals not whatever
