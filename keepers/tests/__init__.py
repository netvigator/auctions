        "Description":"Update I powered up the amp on my Variac and brought it up to full power very slowly over the period of about 4 hours. I added a picture of the amp showing it powered up and another picture showing the tube glowing. So now everyone knows that the amp powers up and I feel a little better too knowing that it still works. Good luck and I have now added the best offer feature for those that would like to make me a reasonable offer can do so. Offered here is a vintage FISHER 400C pre-amplifier. This amp has almost a perfect face plate and the chassis looks good as well just dusty and dirty. I took a rag to a couple of areas and washed off some of the dirt as it has been sitting in the garage for well over 12 years collecting dust and dirt. Many years ago the amp had the selenium rectifier replaced with solid state diodes and some capacitors were also changed at that time as well. All of the controls move freely and very smooth! The tubes are not the original Telefunken tubes. I saw one Telefunken, a bugle boy and the rest were all vintage American tubes, no foreign junk tubes. The amp worked fine before it was put away. Look at my feedback I don\u2019t sell junk. This amp will be packaged very well and will be double boxed to ensure it arrives safely as shown. Please ask any questions you may have prior to purchasing the amp. Thanks for looking. Overseas shipping on this item by Priority Mail only, Registered with delivery notification, No exceptions please don't ask if I can ship it economy!!",

        "Description":"Digital Capacitance Tester Capacitor Meter Auto Range Multimeter Checker 470mF Features: -Brand：Excelvan -Larger measuring range,read up to 470mF/ 470000uF -With auto running averaging function, can read pF more stable and accuracy -Easy to use and fast response time on measuring from 0.01pF to 470000uF Note: 1.*Accuracy maybe affected by the test lead&rsquo;s length and distance of test leads. Especially testing pF small capacitance, shortest test lead is recommended, and be careful the surrounding EMI or RF noise may affect the pF reading. 2.PLEASE DISCHARGE THE CAPACITOR BEFORE TESTING, you can use a screwdriver to short circuit, or series with a resistor around 10 ohm and short for 5 to 10s. There is 1 fast zener diode inside the meter to prevent high voltage, but it is important to discharge the capacitor firstly, as it is a large surge current and voltage and may damage the meter. Package Content 1 X Digital Capacitance Meter 1 X pair test probe Operating Introduction: - POWER ON Press and hold the ON/ OFF circle orange button for 1 to 2 second to power on. Press and release the ON/ OFF button to shut down meter. - AUTO/ MANUAL mode: Auto Range: Press and release the RANGE button and at the first line of LCD will show \\"AUTO:\\" At auto mode meter will automatically select the best range to detect. Manual Range: Scroll the manual range from 47nF, 47uF and 470mF range by press and release the RANGE button In LCD will show MANUAL at first LCD line and show at second line: 0-47NF, 47NF TO 47UF and 47UF TO 470MF. 1 Key Zero: OPEN circuit the test leads terminal. Press and release the &ldquo;ZERO\\" button, LCD shows &ldquo;ZERO\\" and wait the zero disappear. If you are using the meter array socket, you need to OPEN circuit to set zero too. Socket: You can use the 8 pin socket to measure the capacitor Running Average: It will automatically start running average if the capacitance reading become stable and user can get more accuracy reading. During running average it will show &ldquo;AVG&rdquo; at right bottom LCD or it will show raw data icon &ldquo;RAW&rdquo; As a result, if you want to get higher accuracy reading, you can take the reading during AVG display. This function will automatically on, once the raw data is noise. Backlight: LCD backlight will on during power on Auto Sleep: Around 8 to 10 hours for not testing, it will shut down automatically to save power. OVERFLOW or OL: Display overflow when the value is out of range, you can check that you are zero correctly. Specification: Range Accuracy (After Zero, tested with 1nF, 1uF, 1000uF) Refresh Time (Manual Mode) *Auto mode take 0 to 2s more time depend on value Larger capacitance take more measuring time 0.01pF to 47.000nF 1%+2Digit ~0.2s to 1s 47.00nF to 47.000uF 1%+1Digit ~0.2s to 2s 47.00uF to 470.00mF 1 to 3%+1Digit (Larger capacitance will have larger error) ~0.2s to 30s Accuracy Up to 1% (detail on above table) High Resolution 5 digit Measuring voltage <0.8V Clamping voltage ~1.25V (open voltage) Battery 2X AA 1.5V battery(Not Included) Operating current 0.02A Payment Method ★We accept PayPal only. ★NOTE: Payment should be sent within 4 (FOUR) days of auction closing.
